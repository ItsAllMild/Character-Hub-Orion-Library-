## Why should I get Character Hub?
Character Hub allows you to connect and control your character locally. With this, this allows you to control your humanoids behaviors, speed, jumppower, BreakJointsOnDeath, and many more! Me, ItsAllMILD will allow you to modify scripts that are shared, this is only to make modded versions of this Orion Library. You can only modify if you know what you're doing. If you want to add extra buttons or ui items, you can see the Orion Library template (https://github.com/darkkcontrol/Roblox-Orion-UI-Libary-OP-UI-LIBARY-/blob/main/Documentation.md).
